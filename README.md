**Spammer Telegram Complaint Engine** is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of sending complaints to Telegram's support system. This tool allows users to generate random phone numbers and email addresses, and send complaints to Telegram's support with different reasons for reporting. The complaints can be customized based on various scenarios such as reporting spam, policy violations, or account issues. This program aims to streamline the complaint process and can be useful for testing and automation purposes.

To get started with the Spammer Telegram Complaint Engine, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The program requires several Python modules, including `fake_useragent`, `requests`, `termcolor`, and `pyfiglet`. During the initial setup, the tool will check for these dependencies and install them if necessary. Additionally, you need to configure proxy settings to ensure successful communication with Telegram's support system. Proxy details should be stored in a `proxy.txt` file in the format `IP:Port`.

Once the installation is complete, run the program to access the main menu. You will be prompted to choose a reason for the complaint and provide details such as the username, Telegram ID, and number of complaints to be sent. The tool supports various complaint types, including virtual number misuse, spam, and policy violations. After setting up the required information, the program will send the complaints and display the results. For any issues or errors, the program will provide relevant feedback, and you can re-run the tool as needed.
